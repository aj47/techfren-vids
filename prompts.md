# Algorithm of thought
```
1. Define the Problem: AoT begins by clearly stating the problem behind the query or task.
2. Gather Information: Before diving into solutions, AoT prompts the LLM to get the necessary context.
3. Analyze the Information: Next, the LLM breaks down the gathered information, identifying patterns, relationships, or anomalies.
4. Formulate a Hypothesis: Based on the analysis, the LLM puts together an initial solution.
5. Test the Hypothesis: The LLM then thinks of ways to validate or refute its hypothesis, envisioning potential outcomes.
6. Draw Conclusions: After testing, the LLM summarizes its findings, providing a refined solution to the initial problem.
7. Reflect: Lastly, the LLM considers the broader implications of its conclusion, thinking of potential next steps or further questions.
